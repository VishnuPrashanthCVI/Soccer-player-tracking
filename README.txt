LIBRARIES REQUIRED :

1) imutils - This Library consists a series of convenience functions to make basic image processing operations such as translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization, and displaying Matplotlib images easier with OpenCV and Python.
2) NumPy - This Library adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays (Python).
3) OpenCV - This Library consists of functions related to Image processing.

I have done the execution and testing of the program in Linux OS (Ubuntu version 16.06).

Programming Language : PYTHON
Operating System : UBUNTU 16.06


PREREQUISITES (STEP BY STEP):

1) Install PIP (use command : "sudo apt-get install python-pip").

2) Install imutils library. 

3) Install NumPy library (use command : "sudo pip install numpy").

4) Install OpenCV.


PROCEDURE ( How to run the program ) :

1) Go into the respective directory ( where the code is) using "cd <Directory_name>" command.
2) Run the main file using the command "python main.py --video <video-filename>".
